\title{Adds an empty row for every filtered cell}
\usage{
completeExpression(expression, cell_ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{expression}{data.table}

\item{cell_ids}{integer vector}
}
\value{
row complete expression data.table
}
\description{
The UI infers cell_id by the index of the cell in the matrix, which means
that filtered cells have to be added back to the table as empty rows. When
converted to sparse format, they do not take up space. We use the max of the
cell_ids that were filtered, which means this table will not contain cells
above that. But it does not change the index of the cells below, and the UI
does not care.
